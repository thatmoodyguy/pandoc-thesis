* Chapter One
* Wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1-4

The Greek word σοφία (_wisdom_) appears 26 times in the thirteen canonical letters of Paul. However, that usage is far from uniformly distributed. Eight of the letters never use the word. Romans and 2 Corinthians each use σοφία a single time, while Ephesians uses it three times and Colossians six times. The remaining 15 usages of σοφία are in 1 Corinthians, and of those, 14 of them occur in the first four chapters.

This distribution leads to the conclusion that wisdom was not normally a major theme in the Pauline corpus. Why, then, does σοφία get promoted to a lead role in the opening chapters of 1 Corinthians? It seems likely that Paul adopts the language of wisdom in response to the situation at Corinth.

There were two precipitating causes for Paul’s writing of 1 Corinthians. The first (in terms of when Paul received it) was a letter from the Corinthian church, likely delivered to Paul by Stephanus, Fortunatus, and Achaicus (1 Cor. 16:17).[^fee] The second, and the one that seems to have pressed Paul into a quick response, was a report from members of Chloe’s household: “For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers” (1 Cor. 1:11).[^hays]  It is this report of divisions in the church that forms the proximate backdrop to the first four chapters of the epistle, and is the likely reason for Paul’s use of σοφία in those chapters.

[^fee]: Gordon Fee posits that this letter from Corinth was in response to an earlier letter sent from Paul, raising objections to his earlier correspondence. Fee, The First Epistle to the Corinthians, p.7.

[^hays]: Richard Hays believes the report from Chloe’s people to have been alarming enough to spur Paul into action, and that the epistle is a “stopgap measure until Paul himself can get there to deal with the issues in greater depth.” Hays, First Corinthians, p. 6.
